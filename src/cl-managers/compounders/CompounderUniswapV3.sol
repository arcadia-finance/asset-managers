/**
 * @title Compounder for Uniswap V3 Liquidity Positions.
 * @author Pragma Labs
 * @notice The Compounder will act as an Asset Manager for Arcadia Accounts.
 * It will allow third parties (initiators) to trigger the compounding functionality for a Liquidity Position in the Account.
 * The Arcadia Account owner must set a specific initiator that will be permissioned to compound the positions in their Account.
 * Compounding can only be triggered if certain conditions are met and the initiator will get a small fee for the service provided.
 * The compounding will collect the fees earned by a position and increase the liquidity of the position by those fees.
 * Depending on current tick of the pool and the position range, fees will be deposited in appropriate ratio.
 * @dev The initiator will provide a trusted sqrtPrice input at the time of compounding to mitigate frontrunning risks.
 * This input serves as a reference point for calculating the maximum allowed deviation during the compounding process,
 * ensuring that the execution remains within a controlled price range.
